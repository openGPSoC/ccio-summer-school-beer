open source beer recipe for the beers made for the EHI CCIO summer school

MIT license: do as you will

use beer making vessel as described in my Instructable (URL to follow when I've written said Instructable)

1. fill heatproof beer making vessel with 20L cold water
1. heat this water to 65.5 degrees celcius
1. add:
  • 5 kg crushed pale malt (eg maris otter or lager malt)
  • 0.5 kg crushed black (roasted) barley
  • 0.5 kg crushed chocolate malt
  • 0.5 kg rolled barley flakes
1. steep for 1 hour
1. drain liquor into plastic brew bin
1. get rid of the spent grain (feed it to the chickens best, compost it second best, there is no third best)
1.decant liquor (I guess at this stage you could call it 'wort') back into the heatproof vessel
1. boil liquor
1. add hops
  • cascade hop variety 9.2% alpha acid - 1.5 ounces (no apologies for inconsistency of units in this recipe)
1. boil for 1 hour
1. drain into plastic brew bin
1. allow to cool
1. add yeast
1. ferment: 1 week
1. bottle at 1 week with priming sugar (about 1/2 tsp per bottle is about right but it takes practice to guess it)
