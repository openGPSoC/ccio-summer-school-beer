open source beer recipe for the beers made for the EHI CCIO summer school

MIT license: do as you will

use beer making vessel as described in my Instructable (URL to follow when I've written said Instructable)

# fill heatproof beer making vessel with 20L cold water
# heat this water to 65.5 degrees celcius
# add:
  • 5 kg crushed pale malt (eg maris otter or lager malt)
  • 0.5 kg crushed black (roasted) barley
  • 0.5 kg crushed chocolate malt
  • 0.5 kg rolled barley flakes
# steep for 1 hour
# drain liquor into plastic brew bin
# get rid of the spent grain (feed it to the chickens best, compost it second best, there is no third best)
# decant liquor (I guess at this stage you could call it 'wort') back into the heatproof vessel
# boil liquor
# add hops
  • cascade hop variety 9.2% alpha acid - 1.5 ounces (no apologies for inconsistency of units in this recipe)
# boil for 1 hour
# drain into plastic brew bin
# allow to cool
# add yeast
# ferment: 1 week
# bottle at 1 week with priming sugar (about 1/2 tsp per bottle is about right but it takes practice to guess it)
