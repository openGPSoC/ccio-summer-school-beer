open source beer recipe for the beers made for the EHI CCIO summer school

MIT license: do as you will

use beer making vessel as described in my Instructable http://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Self-filter-Mash-Tun-for-All-grain-Beer/

1. fill heatproof beer making vessel with 20L cold water
1. heat this water to 65.5 degrees celcius
1. add:
  • 5 kg crushed pale malt (eg maris otter or lager malt)
  • 1 kg crushed Vienna malt
1. steep for 1 hour
1. drain liquor into plastic brew bin
1. get rid of the spent grain (feed it to the chickens best, compost it second best, there is no third best)
1.decant liquor (I guess at this stage you could call it 'wort') back into the heatproof vessel
1. boil liquor
1. add hops
  • T -30 minutes - Bittering: Citra hop variety 14.8% alpha acid - 0.5 ounces (no apologies for inconsistency of units in this recipe)
  * T -15 minutes - Flavour: Citra hop variety 14.8% alpha acid - 1 ounce
  * T -5 minutes - Aroma: Citra hop variety 14.8% alpha acid - 1 ounce
  * T -0 minutes  - Drain into brew bin
  * T +60 minutes - Dry Hop: Citra hop variety 14.8% alpha acid - 1 ounce (in a muslin bag to aid retrieval at bottling)
1. allow to cool
1. add yeast
1. ferment: 1 week
1. bottle at 1 week with priming sugar (about 1/2 tsp per bottle is about right but it takes practice to guess it)
